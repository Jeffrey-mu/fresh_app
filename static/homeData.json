    "description": "Another thing to consider is the number of ports available in an adapter. Apple’s adapter only allows users to plug in one device, but it doesn’t mean they all have to be that way. Lots of third-party companies are offering multiple ports on a single adapter or charger. So, if you have a lot of devices that needs to be charged at the same time regularly, then consider buying an adapter with at least two ports or more. There is also an adapter that has a mix of USB-C and USB-A available. <br>",

    "content": "<p>Apple has recently released a new iPhone in the market as it does every year. If you are buying a new iPhone 12, you will find one important thing. The packaging of the latest one, the iPhone 12 lineup, is noticeably thin compared to the previous years. This is due to the fact that they have removed the power adapter from the box. Whether you are getting an iPhone SE at the cost of $399 or an iPhone 12 Pro Max at the cost of $1399, you must buy a separate power adapter for this unless you have one available.<br/>If you have been using  an old lightning cable charger, that will still work on the iPhone 12 and  you are good to go but if you have the old 5W adapter then this is the best time to get yourself a new one. The latest USB-C to lightning cable that comes with all the iPhones now is capable of fast-charging. For this to work, you just need the right adapter. <br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Wattage</h2><p><br/></p>When purchasing a new charger or adapter, the first thing you must consider is the wattage that it can supply to your gadget. For many years, Apple has included 5-watt adapters with their iPhones, and this will require about 2.5 hours to fully charge your iPhone. For the iPhone 5 and earlier versions, this was enough since it did not support fast charging yet but with the iPhone 12 lineup, it supports adapters up to 20 Watts. With this, filling up an iPhone to 50 percent would only take about half an hour. Therefore, getting a 20-Watt USB-C adapter is highly recommended. Because of the demand of this adapter, this is easier to find in the market compared to the other ones. When getting this, check whether it supports USB Power Delivery.<p><br/></p><h2>Size and Specifications</h2><p><br/></p>Power adapters or chargers from Apple are known to be light and compact but because of other chargers available in the market by third party companies, it seems bulky. The latest charging technology uses Gallium Nitride &#40;GaN&#41; that allows these adapters to be smaller and more power-efficient. Different companies have started replacing the Silicon with Gallium Nitride which makes the adapters or chargers much smaller in size. One example of these is the Anker PowerPort Atom III which is 35 percent smaller than the adapter for Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro, but delivers 60-Watt charge. Do take note to check the dimensions in the technical specifications of the product unless you’re buying one of the models here-which are all GaN except for apple’s adapter.<p><br/></p><h2>Ports</h2><p><br/></p>Another thing to consider is the number of ports available in an adapter. Apple’s adapter only allows users to plug in one device, but it doesn’t mean they all have to be that way. Lots of third-party companies are offering multiple ports on a single adapter or charger. So, if you have a lot of devices that needs to be charged at the same time regularly, then consider buying an adapter with at least two ports or more. There is also an adapter that has a mix of USB-C and USB-A available.<p><br/></p><h2>Prongs: To fold or not</h2><p><br/></p>With all the things that needs to be considered, now you have to think if you want the prongs to fold or not. Although some  third-party adapters have folding prong and other items if you toss it in a bag. The latest 20W charger from Apple has a protruding prong. This is not a big deal, but you can consider this especially when you travel a lot.Lightning Cable Charger, Fast-charging, 20-Watt USB-C Adapter, Gallium Nitride, Anker PowerPort Atom III, Multiple Ports",

Besides, it will show you how these three models are different and how do they work with other Apple devices.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Check the battery</h2><p><br/></p>There are three ways to check how much battery power your AirPods have. Firstly, for Apple devices, Siri has always been a good assistant. It is whom you can ask that how much power the AirPods have. Secondly, when you put the AirPods in the charging case, if you open the lid of the case, a pop-up window on the iPhone will show how much power the AirPods and the case have. Thirdly, once your AirPods are connected successfully, you can hold down the music app panel from the iPhone&#39;s Control Center, and then you&#39;ll see them above a blue connection icon to the right of the panel. Tap the icon and you’ll see how much battery power is left in your AirPods.<p><br/></p><h2>Charge the AirPods and the case</h2><p><br/></p>Although the AirPods have a modest battery life of around five hours, they can be charged in their charging case. When the AirPods are placed in the case to recharge, the light in the case glows orange. The case is designed to fit the two AirPods nicely, which makes it easier to charge AirPods.While when it comes to the charging cases, things turn out to be different. Unlike you have AirPods inside the case, when the case is charged on its own, the light inside glows orange, indicating that the case itself needs to be charged. And if it turns green, it means the case is fully charged.<p><br/></p>Besides, each case has its own way of charging. If what you have is an original case, just one thing you need to do is to plug in a Lightning cable, which is the same as the AirPods Max. As for Wireless Charging Case or AirPods Pro case, in addition to plugging in the Lightning cable, you can also place the case backside down on a wireless charger that adheres to Qi standard.<p><br/></p><h2>Invoke Siri</h2><p><br/></p>Different models have different ways to invoke Siri. On regular AirPods, there&#39;s only one default way to invoke Siri: double-tapping either AirPod on your left or right ear. While on the AirPods Pro, Siri can be invoked in a variety of ways. For example, you can change the “press and hold” action for the force sensor on the stem to make it. If you’d like to change the feedback when you double-tap or press on your AirPods, you need to find theBluetooth panel, then tap the lower-case &#40;i&#41; icon next to your AirPods to complete the operation.<p><br/></p>In addition to the above methods, you can also invoke it easily by saying “Hi Siri”.<p><br/></p><h2>Lose one Airpod</h2><p><br/></p>Don&#39;t get too upset or worried when you lose an AirPod. You’re able to buy a separate AirPod of the same model that you lost from Apple&#39;s website. Besides, a replacement charging case is also available.<p><br/></p><h2>Locate AirPods</h2><p><br/></p>Theon your Apple devices can locate AirPods exactly. Here is the specific operation process: first of all, you need to open the Find My app, and then move to the Devices tab to select your AirPods. Finally, you can choose to make your AirPods sound, or get the location where they were last connected.<p><br/></p>But there is one thing you need to pay attention: if your Apple devices are too far away from your AirPods, you won&#39;t be able to connect them and make them sound.",

    "content": "<p>Several of the world&#39;s biggest semiconductor companies are facing a growing competitive threat as their most important customers tailor their chips for areas such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence &#40;AI&#41;.<br/><br/>For a long time, chip manufacturing has been dominated by large manufacturers and design companies such as Intel, AMD and Nvidia. But now, tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have joined the game, seeking to improve performance and reduce costs, which has changed the balance of power in the industry and pushed traditional chip manufacturers to respond by making more specialized chips for their main customers. <br/><br/>Amazon released a new chip last year, which the company said promised to speed up the use of AI algorithms to learn from data. Amazon has designed other custom processors for its cloud computing division, AWS, including computer brains called CPU. <br/><br/>The Covid-19 outbreak has accelerated the rise of cloud computing, as companies have generally accepted many digital tools that use these remote servers. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other companies are all benefiting from the strong growth of cloud computing while working remotely. Commercial customers are also showing increasing interest in analyzing the data they collect about their products and customers, which has stimulated the demand for AI tools to enhance the understanding of all this information. <br/><br/>Google is the pioneer among these tech giants. It released an AI processor in 2016 and has updated its hardware many times since then. Software giant Microsoft, the second-largest cloud computing company after Amazon, has also invested in chip design, including a programmable chip to help handle AI tasks and another chip to enhance security. According to people familiar with the company&#39;s plans, Microsoft is also working on a central processing unit currently. <br/><br/>The huge scale of cloud computing giants has brought severe challenge to traditional chip manufacturers. In the past, semiconductor manufacturers tended to design high-performance semiconductors for general use cases, allowing customers to adapt and make the most of the chips. Now, the biggest customers can afford to push for better designs. <br/><br/>Nvidia is currently the most valuable chip manufacturer in the US, with a market value of US$330 billion and Intel’s is US$207 billion. And cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are all worth more than $1 trillion. <br/><br/>The chip customization model stems to some extent from the rise of foundry chip manufacturers, which produce semiconductors designed by other companies. This arrangement helped tech giants avoid the multibillion-dollar cost of building their own chip factories. TSMC, in particular, has leaped to the forefront of chip production technology. <br/><br/>These changes have benefited the chip design company Arm, which sells circuit designs that anyone can use after paying a licensing fee. Apple is a big customer of Arm, as are all the big tech companies that make their own chips. <br/><br/>It is estimated that Amazon, Google and Microsoft each operate millions of servers in a network of data centers around the world for their own use and rent out to millions of cloud computing customers. In these vast technology empires, even small improvements in performance and small reductions in the cost of power supply and chips cooling can make a big difference. Facebook is also exploring its own chip. <br/><br/>Custom chips are also gaining popularity in consumer products. After 15 years of sourcing from Intel, Apple began using its own processors in its Mac computers last year. Google already has its own chip on its Pixel smartphone. <br/><br/>In the race for supremacy in cloud computing and AI chips, established companies are not sitting still. Nvidia agrees to buy Arm this year, which will be the biggest acquisition in the chip industry. <br/><br/>Intel says about 60% of the central processing units sold to servers at large data center operators are customized according to customers&#39; needs, usually by turning off chip functions they don&#39;t need. <br/><br/>Intel has also invested in AI processors and other specialized hardware of its own, including the acquisition of Israel&#39;s Habana Labs for about $2 billion last year. AWS recently agreed to put the company&#39;s AI training chips in its data centers because Amazon is developing its rival chips that it believes will perform better when they appear next year. <br/><br/>Remi El-Ouazzane, chief strategy officer of Intel&#39;s Data Platform Group, said Habana Labs&#39; chips at AWS could challenge Nvidia, which has long dominated the AI training market. He said the AI training business would be worth more than $25bn by 2024. It&#39;s a huge new opportunity for Intel, and it&#39;s also a very large market. &#40;Source: Tecent Tech&#41;</p>",

    "description": "However, analysts says that even though Apple has the ability to conduct internal R&D, its success in electric cars will also depend on deciding which manufacturer to cooperate with. Insiders previously said that they expect Apple to outsource car manufacturing to its partners. Morgan Stanley shows that tech companies which have decided to work with manufacturing partners are in a better position to compete with Tesla than other traditional automakers. While traditional automakers have brought battery-powered cars to market, but no tech company has yet done so. ",

    "subtitle": "Apple has Five Strengths in Car Building, Who will Assemble Apple’s Whole Car is the Focus",
    "content": "<p>After years of twists and turns, Apple will accelerate its self-driving electric car project. Wall Street analysts say that this tech giant has five key strengths, including its popular brand, deep pockets, huge ecosystem, vertical integration capabilities, and strong manufacturing partnerships, which may enable it to bring a consumer-oriented car to the market by 2024.<br/><br/>From any point of view, building an electric car from scratch is an ambitious task, as proved by many startups that tried to replicate Tesla&#39;s success. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets all say that Apple, which has abundant resources and decades of manufacturing expertise, may have the conditions to do so. <br/><br/>In a report to clients, Joseph Spak, an analyst at Capital Markets shows that: first of all, apple&#39;s strong brand will lay the foundation for its successful car launch if its long-rumored auto plan becomes reality, which is something that emerging electric car brands like Rivian, Fisker and Lucid won&#39;t be able to rely on when they launch cars in the near future. <br/><br/>Spake and Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, both agree that Apple’s second strength is its easy access to funds and the ability to attract and retain the top talent, which also lays the foundation for its success. Apple has one of the largest cash reserves in U.S. companies, with more than $191 billion in cash on hand by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter last September. While the data compiled by PitchBook shows that Amazon-backed Rivian, one of the closest startups to delivering its first batch of electric cars, has raised just $6 billion so far. <br/><br/>Jonas also says that Apple&#39;s third strength is its &#34;huge ecosystem, which can increase revenue with regular subscriptions and services.&#34; &#34;The potential value of the service opportunities embedded in the IOC may dwarf the automotive business itself.&#34; Jonas adds. Apple&#39;s services business includes Apple TV, Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud and so on, and its share in Apple’s total sales is growing rapidly. <br/><br/>Industry observers have also noticed that because &#34;over-the-air updates&#34; provide companies with the opportunity to generate recurring revenue from a car sale, the software in the auto industry is more and more important. As far as Tesla is concerned, it plans to launch a subscription service for the &#34;fully autonomous&#34; driver-assistance system in early 2021. <br/><br/>Jonas thinks that Apple&#39;s fourth strength is its ability to integrate vertically. Just like its smartphones and wearable devices, Jonas believes that Apple can change the electric car industry through its vertical integration capabilities. “Apple has recently invested in five core technologies, including processors, batteries, cameras, sensors and displays, which are beneficial for their car development,” Jonas says in the report. <br/><br/>However, analysts says that even though Apple has the ability to conduct internal R&amp;&#39;D, its success in electric cars will also depend on deciding which manufacturer to cooperate with. Insiders previously said that they expect Apple to outsource car manufacturing to its partners. Morgan Stanley shows that tech companies which have decided to work with manufacturing partners are in a better position to compete with Tesla than other traditional automakers. While traditional automakers have brought battery-powered cars to market, but no tech company has yet done so. <br/><br/>&#34;For Tesla, we have long believed that a tech company like Apple cooperating with a manufacturing partner like Foxconn represents a far more formidable competitive threat than other established automakers. Compared with most car companies today, these tech companies may have more advantages in terms of autonomy and iteration technologies &#40;such as storage technology&#41;, which can bring more innovation.&#34; Jonas says. <br/><br/>Austin Russell, co-founder of Luminar, analyzes the details of OEMs. He says, &#34;If you want to build something that can actually be put into production, what you need is to work directly with OEMs, who have been building cars for decades or even centuries. So I think it is where the right cooperation model works.&#34; <br/><br/>Russell adds, “Everyone has something that they are good at. For example, Apple has an incredible ecosystem that it can make full use of. Besides, Apple can also cooperate with different OEMs to integrate development and production technologies. Anyway, if you really want to make it practical, you can&#39;t do without economies of scale, which is a model for producing a large number of cars, and Apple needs to pay close attention to it.&#34; &#40;Source: Tencent Tech&#41;</p>",

    "content": "<p>Investors have begun weighing the scale of their investment in US tech stocks in the coming year as higher valuations, regulatory risk and steep declines in some stocks could make the sector less attractive.In addition, tech stocks have taken a back seat as the vaccine brings hope for economic recovery, which has promoted the rebound of energy, finance, small stocks and other less-popular market sectors. Since the news of a breakthrough in vaccine development was released in early November last year, the Russell 1000 Index has risen 10%, while the Russell Growth index, which is mainly composed of technology stocks, has risen only 4%.It is unclear that how long the shift in market leadership will last, but such a shift does highlight a dilemma that investors have faced in the past decade. For many years, limiting the risk of technology stocks has always been a failed bet, and the Covid-19 pandemic has been conducive to the rapid growth of tech stocks. But valuations near 16-year highs have raised concerns about the vulnerability of the tech sector, especially if the US reopens the sustainable trading that creates value stocks.&#34;I think people are going to stick with their tech investments, but I don&#39;t think there will be a lot of new funds going into it in the new year,&#34; says Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.The combined stock market value of the tech industry and large technology-related companies—Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook—accounts for about 37% of the weighted S&amp;&#39;P 500 Index, which gives them a huge impact on index volatility and investor portfolios.According to the data from Refinitiv, while tech stocks with a P/E ratio of 26 times are one of the few industries with profit growth in 2020, their earnings are expected to grow by only 14.2% next year, which is lower than 23.2% of the overall growth of S&amp;&#39;P 500 companies due to potential growth rebound. &#34;We continue to believe that the value cycle that we have seen in the past few weeks will last in 2021,&#34; says Mona Mahajan, senior US investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.Meanwhile, the efforts that US and European regulators take to curb market-leading companies such as Alphabet and Facebook are another pressure on the technology sector. However, in the context of slow economic growth, trade conflicts and the global Covid-19 pandemic, many investors are willing to retain technology stocks that have proven to be enduring. In fact, the surge in uncertainty in recent months has often led investors to turn to tech stocks. &#34;Very few industries are predictable,&#34; says Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, whose diversified equity fund mainly holds shares of Microsoft, Apple and Amazon.According to the data from Lipper, the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust, which invested in the Nasdaq 100 Index, hit a new high in trading volume in December 2020. Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at Wall Street Global Advisors, predicts that the economy will return to a low growth rate when it recovers in 2021. &#34;This shows that you want to hold a company that has a high organic growth rate and can achieve compound cash flow better than other companies,&#34; Arone says.Even some strategists who prefer other stocks haven’t stayed away from tech stocks yet. In 2021, BMO Capital Markets will cut technology stocks to &#34;market weight&#34;, while it also urges investors to maintain positions rather than sell off. &#34;I don&#39;t think we will give up tech stocks,&#34; says Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. &#34;These tech companies have become an integral part of our lives.&#34;</p>",

    "subtitle": "Experts Predict Five Trends of Bitcoin in 2021: the Price Could Exceed $50,000",
    "content": "<p>Last year is crazy for anybody who invests in, or even just pays attention to the Bitcoin market. Last December, the transaction price of the world&#39;s most valuable virtual currency exceeded $23,000. While when the Covid-19 epidemic first stared in the United States in early March last year, the price of Bitcoin was even less than $4,000.For Bitcoin’s holders or sellers, its appreciation or depreciation can be nerve-wracking. While for those bystanders, this is just a market show full of entertainment, and they may be tinged with jealousy and dizziness.Despite the huge fluctuations in Bitcoin&#39;s price—its trend is generally upward—2020 is a relatively mature year for a cryptocurrency that has only been trading for a decade. And fintech expert James Ledbetter offers five predictions about Bitcoin in 2021:</p><p><br/></p><h2>1.Be more acceptable to mainstream society</h2><p><br/></p>Bitcoin’s use in daily life has always been an &#34;egg or chicken&#34; question: is it because it hasn’t become mainstream, then few people accept or use it? Or is it because so few people use or adopt it that it hasn&#39;t become mainstream? Anyway, the truth is: very few people use or accept it.But in 2020, we’ve seen an amazing evolution in Bitcoin&#39;s adaptability. Well-known financial technology companies have begun to support it. For example, Square invested $50 million to buy Bitcoin, and PayPal started to allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin.In 2021, we are likely to see such a trend of mainstream recognition continue. At least one major bank in the United States or Europe is expected to announce a system in which they either support the purchase of Bitcoin or agree to hold digital assets for their customers.<p><br/></p><h2>2.Big tech companies compete with Bitcoin</h2><p><br/></p>Whether or not Bitcoin has achieved success in its ten years of existence, it has forced a lot of large multinational companies to consider offering an international digital currency.Every company involved in the payment field knows that there is still a market for competition in the digital payment market, and payment businesses that involve different currency markets have the most potential for development. That&#39;s because such deals may take several days to resolve and usually involve high costs.And Bitcoin has shown that, a global digital currency can greatly simplify the process even in its infancy. In the last year, Facebook and Google—both of which have the vast global reach that Bitcoin dreams of—pushed ahead with large-scale digital currency plans.Digital currencies like Facebook Diem are not exactly the same as Bitcoin, but if they start to catch on in 2021, they could eat into Bitcoin&#39;s growth.<p><br/></p><h2>3.Many central banks compete in</h2><p><br/></p>Last year, a report and survey issued by the Bank for International Settlements showed that 80% of the world&#39;s central banks were developing some certain kinds of digital currencies.China has gone further than any other country in digital currency experiments. Recently, a lottery was held in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, in which 100,000 residents each received 200 yuan &#40;$30&#41; in digital currency through a digital wallet. They were encouraged to associate their digital currency with their bank account, and if they didn&#39;t spend it within a few weeks, it would disappear—it’s a good way to advance the experiment.As China begins to try to promote the digital RMB nationwide, it may reduce the demand for Bitcoin and other independent cryptocurrencies. Similar experiments are likely to take place in other countries next year.<p><br/></p><h2>4.Face a new regulatory environment</h2><p><br/></p>President Joe Biden&#39;s team will have more pressing issues to deal with than regulating cryptocurrencies in the first 90 days, and Congress&#39;s attitude on this issue is hard to interpret now.It is a natural assumption that the U.S. Democratic government’s regulatory policies will be more restrictive than that of the Republican government. While some people have asserted that Biden’s rise to power will “be beneficial to the development of cryptocurrency”.Biden&#39;s team are likely to come up with a more comprehensive and reasonable way to regulate cryptocurrency, but they are also unlikely to have a particular preference for Bitcoin.<p><br/></p><h2>5.Continue to fluctuate</h2><p><br/></p>Since Bitcoin&#39;s value is not directly linked to any visible real-world problem &#40;such as fiscal policy or monetary policy&#41;, it can appreciate or depreciate in ways that are difficult to predict or explain.As an investment, Bitcoin is difficult to recommend to anyone who would like to avoid huge losses. Some people say that the price of Bitcoin may reach $50,000 in 2021. Although such statement seems extreme, it is not impossible if investors transfer funds from other assets to Bitcoin.Of course, the price of Bitcoin in 2021 may also show an opposite trend. But one thing seems certain is that: the crazy journey of 2020 will be repeated—so fasten your seat belt.",

The following will tell you everything about AppleCare+, and you can choose whether to buy it or not based on your own needs.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Is it worth buying AppleCare+ if there’s no Apple Store nearby?</h2><p><br/></p>The answer is it is still helpful, because there are multiple ways for you to use AppleCare+.<p><br/></p>Firstly, you can take your Apple device to any UPS store in the United States. As long as you provide the Repair ID number that Apple gave you, the store will ship your device to Apple. Apple will send it to you directly after the repair, and the whole process won’t charge you any freight.<p><br/></p>Secondly, you can ship it directly to Apple, in which case Apple will send you a box and shipping labels, then what you do is just to put your device in the box and ship it. Round-trip freight also doesn’t let you bear.<p><br/></p>Thirdly, if something goes wrong with your Mac, Apple can even send an authorized repairman to your home.<p><br/></p>Fourthly, if the problem with your device is relatively small, Apple will sometimes just ship parts for you to DIY, such as a new charger or remote control.<p><br/></p>Fifthly, of course, if you can go to the Apple store to enjoy the service, you can even book in advance.<p><br/></p><h2>Do you need to prepay for AppleCare+?</h2><p><br/></p>Now you can buy AppleCare+ for a regular monthly payment instead of paying the full 24 months at one time. But monthly payments add up to a higher cost than a one-time payment.<p><br/></p><h2>How do you get by when Apple is still repairing your device?</h2><p><br/></p>Apple provides an Express Replacement Service for its devices. When you use the service, Apple will send you a new device immediately. As long as you haven&#39;t received your repaired device, you needn’t send the new one back. But there are certain conditions to use the service, so you’d better ask Apple to see if you qualify.<p><br/></p><h2>What happens if you sell your product before AppleCare+ is not due?</h2><p><br/></p>If you do so, your buyer will get the remaining days of protection because AppleCare+ is transferable just like AppleCare. So it can be a selling point when you resell your product.<p><br/></p>In addition, you must provide your buyer with the proof of purchase &#40;receipt&#41;, the plan confirmation and contract, and notify Apple via email, etc., so that Apple will know the AppleCare+ Plan’s agreement number, device serial number, and the contact information of your buyer.<p><br/></p><h2>Does AppleCare include a lost or stolen clause?</h2><p><br/></p>AppleCare+ only covers product defects and accidental damage. Although there is a special AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss plan, it is also only available on iPhone. This special plan can compensate for the loss caused by accident, theft or loss twice.<p><br/></p><h2>Is AppleCare+ only applicable to U.S. customers?</h2><p><br/></p>Apple provides services for the majority of Apple devices around the world. Although the terms of service vary from country to country, all services are performed by Apple authorized technicians using genuine Apple parts.<p><br/></p><h2>Can you cancel your purchased AppleCare+ plan?</h2><p><br/></p>If you cancel within 30 days of the purchase, you will receive a full refund minus the price of all services you have received. If it is more than 30 days, you will receive a prorated refund minus all services you received, plus $25 or 10% of your prorated refund, whichever is the lower.",
